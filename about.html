      Dr. Manmohan Singh, renowned economist and politician, served as India’s
      Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 and is celebrated for his transformative
      contributions to India’s economy and governance. As Finance Minister in
      1991, he spearheaded the landmark economic liberalization that opened
      India to global markets, dismantling the restrictive license raj, reducing
      tariffs, and fostering foreign investment, which averted a balance of

      tenure as Prime Minister, India witnessed remarkable economic expansion,
      averaging 8% growth during his first term, and became the world’s
      third-largest economy in purchasing power parity terms. His government
      introduced transformative social welfare programs such as the Mahatma
      Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Right to
      Education Act, and Right to Information Act, significantly improving rural
      livelihoods, education, and governance transparency. Additionally, his
      leadership saw major infrastructure advancements, including highway
      modernization and rural electrification, which bolstered connectivity and
      economic opportunities across the nation. Dr. Singh’s legacy lies in his
      role as a visionary economist and a statesman who shaped modern India.
