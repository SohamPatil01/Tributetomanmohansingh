    <h1>Dr. Manmohan Singh</h1>
    <header>
      India’s fourteenth Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh is rightly acclaimed
      as a thinker and a scholar. He is well regarded for his diligence and his
      academic approach to work, as well as his accessibility and his unassuming
      demeanour.

    <p>
      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was born on September 26, 1932, in a village
      in the Punjab province of undivided India. Dr. Singh completed his
      Matriculation examinations from the Punjab University in 1948. His
      academic career took him from Punjab to the University of Cambridge, UK,
      where he earned a First Class Honours degree in Economics in 1957. Dr.
      Singh followed this with a D. Phil in Economics from Nuffield College at
      Oxford University in 1962. His book, “India’s Export Trends and Prospects
      for Self-Sustained Growth” [Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964] was an early
      critique of India’s inward-oriented trade policy.
      <br />
      Dr. Singh’s academic credentials were burnished by the years he spent on
      the faculty of Punjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of
      Economics. He had a brief stint at the UNCTAD Secretariat as well, during
      these years. This presaged a subsequent appointment as Secretary General
      of the South Commission in Geneva between 1987 and 1990.
