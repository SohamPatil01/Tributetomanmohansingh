    <h3>Policies</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Manmohan Singh's tenure as both Finance Minister and Prime Minister
      was marked by transformative policies that reshaped India’s economy and
      society. As Finance Minister in 1991, he introduced groundbreaking
      economic reforms, including liberalization, privatization, and
      globalization, which dismantled restrictive controls, opened India to
      foreign investment, and set the stage for sustained growth. As Prime
      Minister, his government focused on social welfare, launching landmark
      initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
      Act (MGNREGA) for rural livelihoods, the Right to Education Act (RTE) for
      universal education, and the Food Security Act to ensure subsidized food
      for the poor. His leadership emphasized rural development through the
      Bharat Nirman program and urban modernization via the Jawaharlal Nehru
      National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Dr. Singh also strengthened
      transparency with the Right to Information Act and improved healthcare
      access through the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). On the
      infrastructure front, he expanded national highways and electrification
      efforts. His economic vision extended to global relations, highlighted by
      the India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Agreement, which bolstered energy security.
      Singh’s policies reflected a balance between economic growth and inclusive
      development, solidifying his legacy as a reformist leader.
